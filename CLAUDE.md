# Claude Code Entry Point for Beads

This file is intentionally short. Do not copy workflow, build, storage, or UI
rules here; those details drift quickly when repeated across agent entrypoints.

## Read First

- **Workflow and safety**: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- **Detailed agent operations**: [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **Architecture orientation**: [docs/CLAUDE.md](docs/CLAUDE.md)
- **PR maintenance policy**: [PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md](PR_MAINTAINER_GUIDELINES.md)

## Current Ground Rules

- Run `bd prime` before doing tracked work.
- Follow `go.mod` and [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for build
  and test commands; do not hard-code toolchain versions here.
- Beads uses Dolt as the issue database. Use `bd dolt push` / `bd dolt pull`
  for issue data sync; do not use export/import as a routine git workflow.
- The CLI Visual Design System lives in
  [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md#visual-design-system).
- If this file conflicts with a linked source, trust the linked source and fix
  this file by removing the duplicate.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
